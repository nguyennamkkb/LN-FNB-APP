Printing Unicode with Command mode to Receipt printers are not reliable. The best solution so far is to printing to a UIImage and then send the whole image over to printer.
With this approach, developer can control totally the Unicode printing work and it''s easier to manage the layout.
However, Mono-Font must be used to make alignment more precise.

## Usage

Firstly, we must create a `NSAttributedString`.

- **Implement Swift**:

    ```swift
    let printTemplate = NSMutableAttributedString(string: "")
    ```

Then, we can append new attributed string for this template like this.

- **Implement Swift**:

    ```swift
    printTemplate.append("Hello World!!!\n")
    printTemplate.appendCenter("This is a center body.\n")
    printTemplate.appendBold("End World!!!\n")
    ```

Finally, create image from custom string with page width setting.

- **Implement Swift**:

    ```swift
    let image = printTemplate.rasterize(width: 576)
    ```

Congratulations! You're done. ðŸŽ‰
